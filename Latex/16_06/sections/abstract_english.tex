The exam timetabling problem faced by the University of Antwerp is a complex task requiring the scheduling of exams within constraints. The current process is manual and resource-intensive, resulting in lost time and imperfect exam timetables. We propose a Tabu Search implementation efficient in generating feasible exam timetables. This significantly reduces the amount of time required to generate qualitative timetables.

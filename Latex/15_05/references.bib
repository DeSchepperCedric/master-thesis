abstract = "A general model for the timetabling problem of high schools in Denmark is introduced, as seen from the perspective of the commercial system Lectio1, and an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm is proposed for producing solutions. Lectio is a general-purpose cloud-based system for high school administration (available only for Danish high schools), which includes an embedded application for creating a weekly timetable. Currently, 230 high schools are customers of Lectio, and 191 have bought access to the timetabling software. This constitutes the majority of high schools in Denmark.",

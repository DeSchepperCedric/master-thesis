The exam timetabling problem faced by the \acrfull{ua} is a complex task requiring the scheduling of exams within constraints. The current process is manual and resource-intensive, resulting in lost time and imperfect exam timetables. We propose a \acrlong{tabu} implementation efficient in generating feasible exam timetables. This significantly reduces the amount of time required to generate qualitative time tables.
